# Calendar Application Interview Questions

## Project Overview Questions

### Q: Can you describe the overall architecture of your calendar application?
**A:** Our calendar application uses a modern tech stack with React and Vite on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend. We implemented a weekly view calendar with drag-and-drop event management, similar to Google Calendar. The frontend uses Redux for state management, and we store all data in MongoDB. The application allows users to create, view, edit, and move events across the calendar.

### Q: What motivated your choice of technologies for this project?
**A:** We chose React with Vite for the frontend because it offers fast development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and efficient builds. Tailwind CSS was selected for styling due to its utility-first approach, which speeds up UI development. For state management, Redux (with Redux Toolkit) provides centralized state control that's essential for managing events across components. The backend uses Express.js for its simplicity and flexibility, while MongoDB was chosen for its document-based structure which maps well to event objects.

### Q: How did you approach the project planning phase?
**A:** We started with a detailed analysis of the requirements and created a comprehensive development plan broken down into phases: Project Setup, Backend Implementation, Frontend Base & Redux Setup, Calendar Implementation, Event Interaction, Testing & Refinement, and Documentation & Submission. For each phase, we defined specific tasks and checkpoints to ensure steady progress. This structured approach helped us manage the project timeline effectively and deliver within the 2-day deadline.

## Frontend Implementation Questions

### Q: Explain your implementation of the calendar view.
**A:** We implemented the calendar using React with a weekly view that displays time slots for each day. The calendar grid is constructed with CSS Grid for precise alignment of events. We used the react-big-calendar library for the base structure, but customized it extensively to match our requirements. The implementation handles event rendering, time slot interactions, and provides navigation controls to change weeks.

### Q: How did you implement the drag-and-drop functionality?
**A:** We used react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality. Events are wrapped in draggable components that update their position when moved. When an event is dragged to a new time slot, we calculate the new start and end times, update the Redux store with an optimistic update (for immediate UI feedback), and then send an API request to update the event in the database. If the API request fails, we revert the change in the Redux store to maintain consistency.

### Q: How did you manage state in your application?
**A:** We used Redux with Redux Toolkit for state management. The application state is divided into slices, with the main one being for events. We created action creators for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting events. These actions are dispatched from components and handled by reducers to update the global state. The state includes the event data, loading status, error messages, and UI state like the current week view. We implemented selectors for efficient access to specific parts of the state.

### Q: How did you handle the event creation modal and form?
**A:** The event creation modal appears when a user clicks on a time slot in the calendar. We used a combination of React state and Redux for managing the form. The form includes fields for title, category (with a dropdown of 6 options), date, start time, and end time. We used react-hook-form for form validation and handling. When the form is submitted, we dispatch a Redux action to create the event, which sends a POST request to our API and updates the store upon success.

### Q: How did you implement the search functionality across different calendar views?
**A:** We implemented a unified search system that works consistently across day, week, and month views. The search functionality uses React state to track the search term and filtered events. We created a filtering algorithm that matches events based on title, category, and date/time information. When a user enters a search term, a useEffect hook triggers the filtering process and updates the UI to show only matching events. We also added a search results indicator that displays the number of matched events and provides a quick way to clear the search. The implementation ensures that all views (day, week, month) show the filtered results while maintaining their unique layouts and interactions.

### Q: How do you handle the user experience for searching and filtering events?
**A:** To enhance the user experience for searching, we implemented several key features:
1. Real-time filtering that updates as the user types
2. Clear visual indicators showing when a search filter is active
3. A prominent display of the number of matched events
4. Easy-to-access clear buttons to reset searches
5. Consistent search behavior across all calendar views
6. Case-insensitive matching to make searches more intuitive
7. Multi-criteria searching that checks event titles, categories, and dates
8. Preservation of all calendar functionality (like drag-and-drop) when viewing filtered results

This approach ensures users can quickly find the events they're looking for without disrupting their workflow with the calendar.

## Backend Implementation Questions

### Q: Describe your MongoDB schema for events.
**A:** Our Event schema includes fields for:
- `title`: String (required) - The name/title of the event
- `category`: String (enum of 'exercise', 'eating', 'work', 'relax', 'family', 'social')
- `date`: Date (required) - The calendar date of the event
- `startTime`: Date (required) - Start time with date information
- `endTime`: Date (required) - End time with date information
- `createdAt`: Date - Automatically generated timestamp
- `updatedAt`: Date - Automatically updated when event is modified

We added validation to ensure end time is after start time, and indexes for efficient querying by date ranges.

### Q: How did you implement the API endpoints?
**A:** We created RESTful API endpoints using Express.js:
- GET /api/events - Retrieves all events, with optional query parameters for date filtering
- POST /api/events - Creates a new event with validation
- PUT /api/events/:id - Updates an existing event
- DELETE /api/events/:id - Deletes an event

Each endpoint has a controller function that handles the request, interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose, and returns an appropriate response with error handling.

### Q: How did you handle error scenarios in your API?
**A:** We implemented a centralized error handling middleware in Express that catches errors and returns standardized responses. For validation errors, we return a 400 status code with details about the invalid fields. For database errors, we return appropriate status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors) with meaningful messages. On the frontend, we display these error messages to the user and provide ways to recover or retry operations.

## Testing and Performance Questions

### Q: How did you test your application?
**A:** We tested the application at multiple levels:
1. Unit tests for reducers and utility functions using Jest
2. Component tests for React components using React Testing Library
3. API endpoint tests using Supertest
4. Manual end-to-end testing for user flows

We particularly focused on testing event creation, updating, and the drag-and-drop functionality to ensure they work correctly across different browsers.

### Q: What performance optimizations did you implement?
**A:** Several performance optimizations were implemented:
1. Used React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. Implemented efficient selectors with reselect to minimize state computations
3. Added pagination for event fetching to limit data transfer
4. Used Vite's code splitting to reduce initial load time
5. Implemented lazy loading for components not needed on initial render
6. Added proper indexes in MongoDB for faster queries
7. Used debouncing for drag operations to minimize API calls

### Q: How did you ensure the application would work across different browsers and devices?
**A:** We ensured cross-browser compatibility by:
1. Using CSS that works across modern browsers
2. Testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
3. Implementing responsive design with Tailwind CSS for different screen sizes
4. Using feature detection where necessary
5. Adding polyfills for any required modern JavaScript features not supported in older browsers
6. Using flexible layouts that adapt to different screen dimensions
